## Brief

**Company Name**: Movado

**Company Description**:

We are a big chain of estate agents that sell properties in the UK. We are able to offer an excellent experience because of our friendly and knowledgable local estate agents. Our target audience is people who are looking for their dream home. We want to convey a sense of luxury, while at the same time being down-to-earth.

**Brief**:
You must create a website for employees that will mainly show a list of the company's properties. The goal is to make a website that is easy to navigate. Besides the properties page, the website will need an an agents' page, and a dashboard. The properties page should show all the properties and allow employees to add new properties to the market. There should be a means for agents' to delete to edit properties. They would prefer a modern design, and would like you to use the brand color, which is purple. Take into account the client's preferences and values.
